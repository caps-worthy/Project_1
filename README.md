Python is being used to analyse Uber trips. Uber journeys may be analysed to reveal a variety of trends,
such as the busiest hour for Uber or which day has the most and least trips. I'm utilising a dataset here that is based on Uber journeys from New York.

The following are my conclusions : 
Uber makes the most money on Mondays.
Fewer people utilise Uber on Saturdays.
The busiest hour for Uber is about 6 p.m.
An increase in Uber trips often starts around 5 am.
Near the New York area of Manhattan, the majority of Uber rides start.
